### AI Model
- Good with patterns and associations
- The more data that you have, the better your model will be able to make predictions
- data > training > prediction
#### LLM
- A computer algotithm that processes natural language inputs and predicts the next word based on what it's already seen
- Context Window - the maximum amount of text that a model can process at once
- Tokens - How the AI segments words into grammerical structures. The tokens are then shuffeled into data structures
- Parameteres - The facts that the model understands

### Algorithms vs Models
- Algorithms are procedures applied to a dataset to achieve a certain function or purpose
- Models are the output of an algorithm that has been applied to a dataset
